        <h3>About me</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi I'm Andy Almeida. I'm an undergraduate student at San Francisco State Univeristy majoring in 
          Computer Science. I'm a skateboarder from Southern California. My family both originated from latin countries, with my mom coming from Argentina, and my dad coming from Peru.
          I like to play videogames, travel to different skateparks, and cook.
        </p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          I have a bit of experience in application design and construction, mainly derived from class projects. 
          I have experience in working with a team from the many jobs and extracurriculars I have involved myself in over
          my life. From playing waterpolo, to working as a shift lead at Nekter juicer, I have worked with many different
          kinds of people in a myriad of group settings. I am eager to work with my team to build a strong product.
          I project that this will be one of the biggest projects I have taken part in, and I am excited to see the 
          overall outcome. I think I will learn a lot from this experience, and Ill have something to show for it
          by the end of this semester!
        </p>
